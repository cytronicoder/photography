# Photography

Hey! Welcome to my Next.js-bootstrapped photography showcase. This project is a simple, lightweight, and responsive website that showcases some of my favorite photos I took during my free time at school and outdoors. I hope you enjoy the photos as much as I enjoyed taking them!

The project is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cytronicoder/photography). Of course, the code is open source for you to use, and the photos are also available for download (although, many of them are school photos, and I do not have the rights to distribute them). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cytronical/)!

## Running this locally

Of course, this is built with Next.js, so you can run this locally on your machine. First, run the development server after installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the page!

## What's `main.py`?

This is a neat script that keeps my photos organized. It's a simple Python script that renames all the photos in the `public/photos` directory to a specific numbering format. I wanted to keep the photos in order so that I could easily sort them in the `gallery` component later. You can run it with the command `python main.py` in the terminal.
